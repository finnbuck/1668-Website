            Early explorers attempting to find a way to sail around the north of
            <a href="terranova.html">Terra Nova</a>
            were quickly met with forbidding sheets of ice which blocked all possible passage.
            A 1438 expedition led by captain Douglas Doggard saw the crew mutiny against him when he tried to convince them to keep pushing further north despite increasingly icy conditions.
            Captain Doggard was eventually abandoned on a sandbank near some perilous cliffs with nothing but a pistol and a bottle of 160-proof spirit.
            Somehow, captain Doggard was able to survive until another exploring ship passed by a few years later.
            When they found him he was profoundly changed and refused to speak of his time spent alone. 
            However, he was only all too eager to guide the expeditionary party to mineral rich mining sites.

            The jagged peaks around Tartarus Bay are filled with seams of precious metallic ores and gemstone bearing minerals.
            The Noonday Company runs a penal colony in along the frozen shores of the bay where countless unfortunate prisoners are forced to mine for riches.
            The penal colony is commonly referred to as <i>Tartarus Peak</i>. Few escape it and even fewer live to serve out their terms in the mines.
