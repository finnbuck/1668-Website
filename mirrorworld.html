        <h1>The Mirror World</h1>
        <p>
            The Mirror World is a world very similiar to the world of 1668---except that it is inhabited by highly intelligent apes that look somewhat like large bipedal chimpanzees.
            The society that the apes of this world live in has advanced far ahead in terms of technology.
            They drive cars, where suits and smoke cigars. 
            Their police forces carry submachineguns.
            In some of the ape metropolises there are zoos where humans from other dimensions are kept.
