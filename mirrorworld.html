        <h1>The Mirror World</h1>
        <p>
            The Mirror World is a world very similiar to the world of 1668 -- except that it is inhabited by highly intelligent apes that look somewhat like large bipedal chimpanzees.
            The society that the apes of this world live in is greatly advanced in terms of technology.
            They drive cars, wear suits and smoke cigars.
            Their writing system is sophisticated, but individual characters resemble pictograms of tropical fruit.
            Their police forces carry submachineguns.
            In some of the ape metropolises there are zoos where humans from other dimensions are kept.
