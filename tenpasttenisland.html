        <h1>Ten-Past-Ten Island</h1>
        <p>This island lies close to the end of <a href="graybay.html">Gray Bay</a> and is a common stop for sailors making the journey over from the old world.
        It's main settlement is  <a href="hopesend.html">Hopesend</a> and around a year ago the Iron Coral appeared on its western coast.
        It is said that a much larger portion of the island used to be settled with small family farms and hamlets,
        however the middle portion of the island is now covered by a forbidding marsh full of high strangeness.
        Sages theorise that this may be due to an unkown corrupting substance bleeding through from another dimension.</p>
