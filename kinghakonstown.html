        <h1>King Hakon's Town</h1>
        <h2>Population: ~13,000</h2>
        <p>
            Situated at the tip of 
            <a href="graybay.html">Gray Bay</a>,
            King Hakon's town boasts an ideal natural harbor.
            In the year 1453 King Hakon, an exiled
            <a href="oldsirkassia.html">Sirkassian</a>
            monarch, made landfall at the future location of the town and decreed that it would become a new Sirkassian fiefdom in the 
            <a href="terranova.html">New World</a>.
            Bankrolled by a royal treasury King Hakon's Town grew quickly,
            with many proud and expensive buildings soon towering above the once desolate bay.

        <p>
            Unfotunately, the hills around King Hakon's Town are rugged and not well suited for large-scale agriculture.
            This has always limited the size of the town and it is heavily reliant on shipments of food arriving from the Old World.
            There is also no major source of industry that would justify the existence of a large settlement at the end of Gray Bay.
            Fishing plays an important role in the town's economy, as does the collecting of rare species from the surrounding hills and woods. 
            <a href="portredolent.html">Port Redolent</a>,
            countless leagues to the south, is now considered by most to be the most important city on Terra Nova.

            With its scenic views of the bay and impressive buildings King Hakon's Town is a popular destination for travelers.
            Many of them end up staying at the Grand Hotel overlooking the harbor.
            There is also a grand temple to
            <a href="hasturthecloudshepherd.html">Hastur the Cloud Shepherd</a>
            known as the Silver Tabernacle located near the center of the town.
            King Hakon himself was buried back in Sirkassia, but his sword was taken back to King Hakon's Town and is displayed in the local parliament.

            Legend has it that prior to the town's founding King Hakon had a romantic encounter with a strange sentient being from the bay.
            The descendents of the children produced by this union are still rumored to haunt the deep waters.
            Fishermen often tell this story to explain the strangely humanoid aquatic corpses that are occasionally found caught in their nets.
