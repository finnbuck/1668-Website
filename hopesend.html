        <h1>Hopesend</h1>
        <h2>Population: ~4,200</h2>
        <p>Hopesend is a minor new world port town and the largest settlement on <a href="tenpasttenisland.html">Ten-Past-Ten Island</a>. It is known for its terrible seafood based cuisine.
        Most of the food eaten there consists of pickled fish. It tends to be cold, greasy and thoroughly unappetizing.
        Hopesend tavern owners have a reputation for relentlessly oversalting their food -- this habit is so notoriously bad that news of it has traveled even to the farthest corners of the old world.
        The city is walled and closed off from the rest of Ten-Past-Ten island at night due to the many unkown dangers that stalk the marshes there.
