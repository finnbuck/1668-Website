        <h1>The Pit of Hades</h1>
        <p>
            Most religions claim that the pit of hades is where the souls of evildoers go to spend their eternal punishment.
            Most contemporary sages disagree and argue that this extradimensional pit is simply the natural resting place of <i>all</i> souls.
            Whether or not they suffer there is unknown.
