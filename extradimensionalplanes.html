        <h1>Extradimensional Planes</h1>
        <p>These planes of existence lie within spaces beyond the three spatial and one temporal dimension of the world of 1668.
        As a rule they are little understood and seldom visited domains where the rules of nature are routinely bent, if not broken.
        Getting to these places usually requires complex magical rituals or outright divine intervention.
        Getting back can be even harder.
