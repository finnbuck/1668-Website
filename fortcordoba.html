        <h1>Fort Cordoba</h1>
        <h2>Population: ~7,500</h2>
        <p>Fort Cordoba was founded in 1540 as a naval base aimed at clearing the <a href="pearlsofmagdalena.html">Pearls of Magdalena</a> of their many pirate nests and it lies at the southernmost point of the mainland.
            The operation against the pirates proved to be a failure over many decades and the Sirkassian navy soon had to turn its attention elsewhere,
            leaving the old fort to become a sleepy provincial town over the course of the next one-hundred years. </p>
