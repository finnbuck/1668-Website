        <h1>The Void Between the Stars</h1>
        <p>
            Not much is known about this dark and cold dimension.
            Sages theorise that it is this void that demons and other unsavory entities spring from.
            There are rumors that an almighty entity rules this vast expanse: the Emperor of the Void.
