        <h1>Port Redolent</h1>
        <h2>Population: ~120,000</h2>
        <p>
            At the mouth of the 
            <a href="mellowriver.html">Mellow River</a>
            lies Port Redolent.
            Ever since it was first established in 1444 the city has grown rich from the trade in rare sea-foods.
            These are caught primarily in
            <a href="laketulforous.html">Lake Tulforous</a>.
            Recent industry has also branched out to logging in the Deepwood,
            though it is still very hard to find people willing to do that sort of work since the forest has such a bad reputation.
            Port Redolent is the easiest part of
            <a href="terranova.html">Terra Nova</a>
            to reach from 
            <a href="nessalios.html">Nessalios</a>,
            so no matter where they come from, 
            almost all manner of exotic goods from the new world pass through it on their way to the old world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city is sprawling and poorly organized stretching across several muddy islands in the delta of the Mellow River.
            The many waterways that lead out to the sea make it tempting for smugglers to try and ferry strange creatures poached from the lake to other parts of the world.
            Scholars believe that this could lead to dangerous unintended consequences and, in any case,
            it has the potential to cut into the profits won from the lake,
            so the militia of Port Redolent cracks down on these smuggling rackets aggressively.

        <p>
            An early legend about Port Redolent claims that in 1446 it was attacked by a great mob of carnivorous giant frogs.
            No such creatures have ever been seen again,
            but at the time the event was reported as a very real calamity which killed half the population of the nascent town.
