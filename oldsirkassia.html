        <h1>Old Sirkassia</h1>
        <h2>Population: ~8,000,000</h2>
        <p>
            Sirkassia is a vast old-world empire that has been in a steady state of decay for centuries.
            It has a long and proud history,
            with many of the worldâ€™s greatest philosophical and alchemical advances being due to Sirkassian scholars and mages.
            Its capital city is the immortal metropolis of 
            <a href="nessalios.html">Nessalios</a>,
            which lies on the edge of the 
            <a href="widdershinssea.html">Widdershins Sea</a>. 
            It still harbors a grand imperial navy boasting 300 
            <a href="sirkassianmanofwar.html">Sirkassian Men of War</a>.
            Nessalios is also the headquarters of a powerful and secretive organization known as the 
            <a href="lachrymosemasks.html">Lachrymose Masks</a>. 
            This group takes an interest in politics and trade across the known world.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Sirkassian society is rigidly feudal,
            with fealty to a local warlord being an indispensable prerequisite for land ownership.
            Native Sirkassians tend to orient themselves strongly around their venerable traditions.
            They thus often appear haughty or even somewhat pretentious to outsiders. 
            One peculiar custom of the noble families of Sirkassia is for them to pass ceremonial masks down through generations.
            This allows the current lord of an estate to always be recognisable by the same distinctive mask.
        </p>
        <p>
            A slim majority of the inhabitants of Sirkassia belong to the cult of 
            <a href="hasturthecloudshepherd.html">Hastur the Cloud Shepherd</a>,
            while in ancient times the cult of the Ashen Countenance was dominant.
            Humans of Sirkassian origin are generally known to be of medium build,
            with lightly tanned to darker brown skin and dark hair.
            However, the empire spans many different groups. 
            It is therefore likely that two people from different ends of the empire will look quite different from one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Sirkassian explorers that originally found the new world.
            Many of the first coastal settlements of 
            <a href="terranova.html">Terra Nova</a>
            can therefore be traced back to Sirkassian origins. 
            With time the cities of Terra Nova have drifted out of touch with the old empire though,
            to the point that most new-world Sirkassians do not feel any particular loyalty to the Sirkassian empire itself.
