        <h1>The Beladonian Confederation</h1>
        <h2>Population: ~4,000,000</h2>
        <p>
            Beladonia is a rugged peninsula on the border with the 
            <a href="oldsirkassia.html">Sirkassian Empire</a>.
            The landmass consists mostly of a patchwork of arid mountain ranges and windswept cypress forests,
            with dusty terrace farms clinging to the edges of its many seasonal rivers. 
            Mysteriously, the weather over Beladonia always seems to be cloudy,
            but it also almost never rains here except during a brief rainy season in early spring.
        </p>

        <p>
            For decades the inhabitants of this land have waged a bloody war of independence against the collapsing Sirkassian Empire.
            The heavily fortified Beladonian capital of 
            <a href="ortoga.html">Ortoga</a>
            has been besieged countless times,
            but whenever it seems that the Sirkassian legions have the upper hand the Beladonians retreat back into the hills. 
            There they can continue a guerilla war until the invading legions are forced to turn elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beladonian society is deeply religious and organized around tight-knit tribes.
            The tribal society has historically led to a lot of infighting between Beladonians,
            but for the time being they have put aside their differences in order to stand up to the sprawling Sirkassian Empire.
            The vast majority of Beladonians adhere to the cult of 
            <a href="mothermagdalena.html">Mother Magdalena</a>. 
            This religious unity is one of the defining features of Beladonian identity. 
            Generally speaking, Beladonians tend to have slight builds and are often freckled.
            Their elfin proportions however belie their famed prowess in battle – 
            the Beladonian martial tradition has indeed produced some of the known world’s most fearsome warriors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the devastating war that has endured in their homeland for so long,
            many Beladonians have left to start new lives on 
            <a href="terranova.html">Terra Nova</a>.
            There they have gained grudging acceptance from the preexisting population of new-world Sirkassians –
            who no longer care all too much about the affairs of the old empire in any case. </p>
