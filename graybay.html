            Gray bay is a vast inlet with steep mountainous banks that ends at 
            <a href="kinghakonstown.html">King Hakon's Town</a>. 
            It is rumored to be haunted by strange sentient fish creatures and fishermen shun it after dark.
            It is also known for its large population of fur seals, which are often hunted for profit.
